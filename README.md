# ESP32-NMEA-Generator-Decoder-Mqtt
This project involves using an ESP32 microcontroller to generate and decode NMEA (National Marine Electronics Association) data. The ESP32 connects to a WiFi network and communicates with a public MQTT broker to publish and subscribe to specific topics. The project includes generating random NMEA sentences, decoding them.
